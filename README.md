# Video-frames-Prediction-using-Convloutional-LSTM
This repository contains the implementation of a ConvLSTM-based model designed for video frame prediction. The model predicts future frames in a video sequence, which can be used in various applications such as video compression, action recognition, or autonomous driving systems where predicting future frames is critical.
